* Design System: "Modern Terminal"

  The website's theme will be inspired by modern terminal aesthetics to feel authentic to A.C.E.'s environment.

  ** Color Palette: Catppuccin (Mocha Flavor)
  - /Background/: `#1e1e2e` (Base)
  - /Text/: `#cdd6f4` (Text)
  - /Headings & Borders/: `#9399b2` (Overlay2)
  - /Primary Accent/: `#cba6f7` (Mauve) - For buttons and links.
  - /Secondary Accent/: `#94e2d5` (Teal) - For highlights.

  ** Typography
  - /Headings & Body/: Inter (sans-serif)
  - /Code & Commands/: JetBrains Mono (monospace)

  ** UI Elements
  - Main content will be in a bordered "window".
  - Feature showcases will use "pane" layouts inspired by `tmux`.
